# AngularIntro

This project is aimed to be a skeleton used for introductory tasks regarding angular aimed towards enterprise applications.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.0.

## Quick Start

-   Install nodejs version 18.14.2 (optionally install nvm and install nodejs through nvm)
-   Install Angular CLI. (Optionally globally)
-   Run `npm ci` to install dependencies.
-   Run `npm start` for running the app in dev server.
-   Navigate to `https://localhost:4200/`.

## Developer tools

Required plugins:

-   Angular Language Service
-   ESLint
-   Prettier - Code formatter

Recommended:

-   Set prettier as the default formatter for your code editor.
-   Enable format on save for your code editor.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running lint

Run `npm run lint` to execute eslint linting operations. Set to accept 0 warnings. If you need a rule ignored use _eslint-disable_ and specify why this rule is ignored.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Translations

To extract translations just use `npm run i18n`. The app is currently configured to have a "special" en-x-source locale which is only used so we don't always overwrite the en.json localization file with each extract. This helps to handle EN translations without changing the template source code.

**Note**: You need to use the JSON translation/interpolation format for your translation files.
